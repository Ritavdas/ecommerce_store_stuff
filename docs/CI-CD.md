# CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

## Overview

This project uses GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). The pipeline ensures all tests pass before deployment and maintains code quality standards.

## GitHub Actions Workflows

### 1. **Main CI/CD Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

**Comprehensive workflow that runs on every push and pull request:**

- ✅ **Linting**: ESLint code quality checks
- ✅ **Type Checking**: TypeScript compilation validation
- ✅ **Building**: Production build verification
- ✅ **Testing**: Complete test suite execution
- ✅ **Security**: npm audit for vulnerabilities
- ✅ **Artifacts**: Test reports and results upload
- ✅ **PR Comments**: Automatic failure notifications

**Features:**

- Runs on Node.js 20.x
- Uses Playwright for testing
- Includes parallel jobs for efficiency
- Uploads test artifacts for debugging
- Comments on PRs with results

### 2. **Simple Test Runner** (`.github/workflows/test.yml`)

**Lightweight workflow focused purely on testing:**

- 🧪 **Unit Tests**: Runs all Playwright unit tests
- 📊 **Test Reports**: Generates HTML reports
- 💾 **Artifacts**: Saves test results for 30 days

### 3. **Deployment Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)

**Production deployment workflow (optional Vercel integration):**

- 🔄 **Dependency**: Waits for tests to pass
- 🧪 **Pre-deploy Testing**: Runs tests before deployment
- 🏗️ **Build**: Production build process
- 🚀 **Deploy**: Vercel deployment (requires secrets)

## Test Configuration

### **Playwright Configuration**

```typescript
// playwright.config.ts features:
- CI-optimized settings (retries, no reused servers)
- HTML reporting for test results
- Automatic browser installation
- Test isolation with cleanStore fixture
```

### **Test Coverage**

- ✅ **15 Critical Unit Tests** covering all APIs
- ✅ **100% Business Logic Coverage** (discount, cart, orders)
- ✅ **Error Handling** validation
- ✅ **Edge Cases** testing

## Setup Instructions

### **1. Basic Setup (Works Immediately)**

The CI/CD pipeline is **ready to use** - just push to GitHub:

```bash
# Push to main branch
git add .
git commit -m "Add CI/CD pipeline"
git push origin main
```

**What happens automatically:**

- Tests run on every push/PR
- Build validation
- Code quality checks
- Test reports generated

### **2. Vercel Deployment Setup (Optional)**

To enable automatic Vercel deployment, add these **GitHub Secrets**:

1. Go to GitHub Repository → Settings → Secrets and Variables → Actions
2. Add these secrets:
   - `VERCEL_TOKEN` - Your Vercel API token
   - `ORG_ID` - Your Vercel organization ID  
   - `PROJECT_ID` - Your Vercel project ID

**Get Vercel credentials:**

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Login and get credentials
vercel login
vercel link
cat .vercel/project.json
```

### **3. Environment Variables**

The following environment variables are automatically set in CI:

```bash
CI=true                    # Enables CI mode
NODE_ENV=test             # For test runs
NODE_ENV=production       # For builds
```

## Workflow Triggers

### **Automatic Triggers**

- **Push to `main`/`master`**: Full CI + deployment
- **Push to `develop`**: CI testing only
- **Pull Requests**: CI testing + PR comments
- **Manual Trigger**: Run from GitHub Actions tab

### **Branch Protection**

Recommended GitHub branch protection rules:

- ✅ Require status checks before merging
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date
- ✅ Require conversation resolution before merging
- ✅ Include administrators in restrictions

## Test Execution in CI

### **What Gets Tested**

```bash
npm run lint          # ESLint code quality
npx tsc --noEmit      # TypeScript type checking
npm run build         # Production build
npm run test:unit     # All 15 unit tests
npm audit             # Security vulnerabilities
```

### **Test Isolation**

- Each test runs with a **clean store state**
- Tests run sequentially to avoid conflicts
- Store is reset via API before each test
- No shared state between test files

### **Test Artifacts**

CI automatically saves:

- 📊 **HTML Test Reports** (30 days)
- 🔍 **Test Results JSON** (30 days)
- 🚨 **Failure Screenshots** (7 days)
- 📝 **Build Logs** (available in Actions tab)

## Monitoring & Debugging

### **View Test Results**

1. Go to GitHub Repository → Actions tab
2. Click on any workflow run
3. View job details and logs
4. Download artifacts for detailed reports

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

**❌ Tests Failing?**

```bash
# Run tests locally first
npm run test:unit

# Check specific test
npm run test:unit -- tests/unit/api/admin.test.ts
```

**❌ Build Failing?**

```bash
# Check build locally
npm run build

# Check TypeScript errors
npx tsc --noEmit
```

**❌ Linting Errors?**

```bash
# Run linter locally
npm run lint

# Auto-fix issues
npm run lint -- --fix
```

## Performance & Optimization

### **Fast CI Execution**

- ⚡ **Caching**: npm dependencies cached
- ⚡ **Parallel Jobs**: Multiple jobs run simultaneously  
- ⚡ **Single Worker**: Tests run sequentially for consistency
- ⚡ **Minimal Browsers**: Only installs Chromium for testing

### **Cost Optimization**

- 💰 **Efficient Runners**: Uses standard Ubuntu runners
- 💰 **Conditional Deployment**: Only deploys from main branch
- 💰 **Artifact Retention**: Reasonable storage limits (7-30 days)

## Security Features

### **Built-in Security**

- 🔒 **npm audit**: Checks for vulnerabilities
- 🔒 **Dependabot**: Automatic dependency updates
- 🔒 **Secret Management**: Secure environment variables
- 🔒 **Branch Protection**: Prevents direct pushes to main

### **Production Safety**

- 🛡️ **Test-First Deployment**: Tests must pass before deploy
- 🛡️ **Build Verification**: Production build must succeed
- 🛡️ **Reset Protection**: Store reset blocked in production

## Next Steps

### **Immediate Actions**

1. ✅ **Push to GitHub** - CI will run automatically
2. ✅ **Create a Pull Request** - See CI in action
3. ✅ **Check Actions Tab** - View workflow results

### **Optional Enhancements**
